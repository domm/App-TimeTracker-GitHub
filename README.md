# NAME

App::TimeTracker::Command::GitHub - App::TimeTracker GitHub plugin

# VERSION

version 1.001

# DESCRIPTION

Connect tracker with [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Using the GitHub plugin, tracker can fetch the name of an issue and use
it as the task's description; generate a nicely named `git` branch
(if you're also using the `Git` plugin).

# CONFIGURATION

## plugins

Add `GitHub` to the list of plugins.

## github

add a hash named `github`, containing the following keys:

### user \[REQUIRED\]

Your github user name. Best stored in your global TimeTracker config file.

### token \[REQUIRED\]

Your personal access token. Get it from your github settings
(Developer Settings, Personal access token): https://github.com/settings/tokens

Best stored in your global TimeTracker config file.

### repo \[REQUIRED\]

The name of the repository you are working on. Currently a required
entry to the config file, but we might upgrade it to a command line
param and/or try to guess it from the current working dir or your git
config.

### api\_uri

Optional.

Set this to the URL of your local GitHub Enterprise installation.

### upstream

Optional.

If the project you are working on has an upstream project where issues are
handled, then you can set upstream to a hash of user and repo (like on a normal
project) to fetch issues from there.

# NEW COMMANDS
